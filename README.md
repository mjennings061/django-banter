# Server-Side Execution
Investigating the use of server-side processing to manage and execute algorithms in a code-free environment. 
This is a Django-based (Python) project

## Example Use-Case
This project has been designed to promote the democratisation of digital signal processing (DSP) to non-developers. 
This system may be used by non-developers or clinicians to process biomedical data in a trial-and-error format without 
the need to write code or have a deep understanding of DSP principles.

## Usage
1. Create your `SECRET_KEY` in `ecg/ecg/settings.py`. By default, the system looks for a file. Feel free to comment this out and use the example `SECRET_KEY` for development
2. In the project directory, install dependencies using:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start the project using:
```commandline
python manage.py runserver
```
4. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser to view the app. If you have another web app running, use:
```commandline
python manage.py runserver 8080
```
5. Create an administrator account
```commandline
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
6. Ensure the project is running via point four. Access the admin interface via `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
7. As an admin, upload `Script` files as either MATLAB or Python files that accept a single argument with the file path
   of the data file. They must output a single data file.
8. Create a user login via `http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/`
9. Upload data as a user via `http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload/`
10. View user files via `http://127.0.0.1:8000/show_files/`
11. Process a script by creating an algorithm using `http://127.0.0.1:8000/create_algorithm/`
12. View the created algorithms via `http://127.0.0.1:8000/show_files/show_algorithms/`

## Structure
Core project is named 'ecg'. There is a single app called 'core'. The base HTML file is templates/base.html.
